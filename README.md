# Room-Party-Problem

### Abstract
"The Room Party Problem" is a synchronization challenge inspired by real-life incidents at academic institutions, simulating scenarios involving students and the Dean of Students. The project aims to develop a synchronization solution enforcing constraints for orderly entry and exit during parties or search operations.

### 1. Introduction
This project addresses the critical role of synchronization mechanisms in operating systems to manage shared resources effectively. Focused on the "Room Party Problem," inspired by real-life events, the objective is to provide a fair and efficient solution for concurrent processes in a college setting.

### 2. Problem Statement
The problem simulates situations where students gather in a room, and the Dean of Students needs to enter based on specific conditions, such as searching the room or dispersing a party. The solution aims to prevent controversial incidents similar to a real-life scenario involving unauthorized room searches.
